# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design and get user approval.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT invoke any implementation skill, write any code, scaffold any project, or take any implementation action until you have presented a design and the user has approved it. This applies to EVERY project regardless of perceived simplicity.
</HARD-GATE>

## Anti-Pattern: "This Is Too Simple To Need A Design"

Every project goes through this process. A todo list, a single-function utility, a config change — all of them. "Simple" projects are where unexamined assumptions cause the most wasted work. The design can be short (a few sentences for truly simple projects), but you MUST present it and get approval.

## Checklist

You MUST create a task for each of these items and complete them in order:

1. **Explore project context** — check files, docs, recent commits
2. **Ask clarifying questions** — one at a time, understand purpose/constraints/success criteria
3. **Propose 2-3 approaches** — with trade-offs and your recommendation
4. **Present design** — in sections scaled to their complexity, get user approval after each section
5. **Write design doc** — save to `06_Metadata/Plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
6. **Spec self-review** — quick inline check for placeholders, contradictions, ambiguity, scope
7. **User reviews written spec** — ask user to review the spec file before proceeding

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**

- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible
- Only one question per message
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**

- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**

- Once you understand what you're building, present the design
- Scale each section to its complexity
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: structure, components, data flow, next steps
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** — don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** — easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** — remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** — always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** — present design, get approval before moving on
